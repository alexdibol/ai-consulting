# AI for Consulting & Corporate Strategy

## What this repository contains
This repository supports the book **AI for Consulting & Corporate Strategy**, an educational, governance-first guide for **management consulting and in-house corporate strategy** work.

It is designed to help consultants, strategy teams, CFO office, transformation leaders, and operating executives develop a clear mental model of what generative AI can do **today**, where it introduces new risks, and how it can be used responsibly under **client confidentiality, independence/COI policies, IP constraints, quality assurance, documentation, and executive-communication** expectations.

The focus is not speed, automation, or “AI deciding strategy,” but **defensible thinking, traceability, and review-ready evidence**.

## The book’s core idea: a five-level maturity ladder
This book treats generative AI **not as an authority**, but as a drafting and reasoning tool whose usefulness depends on **controls, verification, and accountability**.

It introduces a five-level maturity ladder that progresses from individual productivity to organization-grade consulting and strategy operations:

- **Level 1 — Chatbots:** supervised drafting of client emails, meeting summaries, workshop notes, and executive-ready prose  
- **Level 2 — Reasoners:** explicit issue trees, alternatives, trade-offs, assumptions registers, gap detection, and verification planning  
- **Level 3 — Agents:** multi-step workflows with human checkpoints (intake → analysis scaffolds → draft storyline → QA packet) and immutable logs  
- **Level 4 — Innovators:** reusable, tested assets such as playbooks, templates, storylines, evaluation harnesses, and supervision workflows  
- **Level 5 — Organizations:** an operating model covering intake classification, confidentiality controls, QA/review routing, change control for AI assets, recordkeeping/audit bundles, monitoring, and retrieval

At every level, **facts are separated from assumptions**, and all outputs default to **“Not verified.”**

## Independent pedagogical evaluation by OpenAI-ChatGPT (MBA / MFin)
This book has **exceptionally high pedagogical value** for MBA and MFin students when the **author is also the instructor**, because it functions as a fully integrated teaching system rather than a standalone text.

The five-level maturity ladder provides a clear managerial mental model: as AI capability increases, governance, controls, and accountability must increase in parallel. The companion Google Colab notebooks reinforce this by requiring students to produce review-ready artifacts—run manifests, prompt logs, risk registers, and draft deliverables—shifting learning away from “AI outputs” toward **defensible consulting process design**.

The recurring mini-cases allow students to revisit the same strategy problems with increasing rigor, creating a strong spiral curriculum in hypothesis discipline, assumption management, stakeholder communication, and operating-model design. Because the instructor authored the framework, expectations, grading criteria, and professional discipline can be enforced consistently, reducing ambiguity and superficial AI use.

Overall, the book excels at teaching **how teams should govern AI for high-stakes strategic work**, not merely how to use it.

**Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)**

## What makes this governance-first (and why that matters in consulting)
The focus is professional defensibility and review readiness. Each chapter emphasizes controls that make AI-assisted work safer to review and harder to misuse:

- Explicit separation of **generation vs. verification**
- Clear labeling of **facts provided, assumptions, open items, risks, and dependencies**
- No fabricated benchmarks, market facts, customer claims, competitor details, or authoritative citations
- Governance-native artifacts: run manifests, prompt logs, risk logs, versioned deliverables, and reviewer sign-offs
- Human ownership required for any client-facing or decision-relevant output
- Recordkeeping discipline: preserve prompts and outputs when used for client deliverables or internal executive decision support
- Confidentiality discipline: default to redaction and “minimum necessary” inputs; follow client and firm policy on tool usage

These controls align with real consulting QA expectations and corporate governance realities.

---

## Recurring mini-cases used across all chapters
Each level is demonstrated using the same recurring case types:

- **Market entry and growth strategy**
- **Cost transformation and productivity**
- **Capital allocation and portfolio strategy**
- **Operating model redesign and execution governance**

Each chapter concludes with a **minimum standard checklist** that can be adopted directly in practice.

## Important note (read carefully)
This repository and book are **educational materials**. They are **not professional advice** and do not replace professional judgment.

All AI-generated outputs must be reviewed and verified by qualified professionals before any client use or reliance-bearing use. Client confidentiality, independence/COI policies, IP restrictions, and firm QA requirements apply at every level.

Do **not** input sensitive or confidential client information into external AI tools unless explicitly permitted by policy and contract. Use redaction and “minimum necessary” inputs by default.

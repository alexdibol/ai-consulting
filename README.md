# AI for Consulting & Corporate Strategy (Governance-First)

## What this repository contains
This repository supports the book **AI for Consulting & Corporate Strategy**, an educational, governance-first guide for **professional consulting practice**.

It is designed to help consultants, strategy teams, and transformation leaders develop a clear mental model of what generative AI can do **today**, where it introduces new risks, and how it can be used responsibly under real-world constraints: **client confidentiality, conflicts, supervision, defensible analysis, and reviewability**.

The focus is not speed or automation, but **professional defensibility, traceability, and auditability**.

## The book’s core idea: a five-level maturity ladder
This book treats generative AI **not as an authority**, but as a tool whose usefulness depends on **controls, verification, and accountability**.

It presents a five-level maturity ladder that progresses from individual assistance to organization-grade operations:

- **Level 1 — Chatbots:** supervised drafting of slides, emails, meeting notes, and client-ready narratives  
- **Level 2 — Reasoners:** structured problem decomposition, issue trees, hypotheses, alternatives, and trade-offs  
- **Level 3 — Agents:** multi-step workflows with human checkpoints and immutable logs  
- **Level 4 — Innovators:** reusable, tested AI assets such as playbooks, templates, and evaluation harnesses  
- **Level 5 — Organizations:** an end-to-end operating model with intake, scope control, risk review, QA, sign-off, archiving, and retrieval  

At every level, **facts are separated from assumptions**, and all outputs default to **“Not verified.”**

## Independent Pedagogical evaluation by OpenAI-ChatGPT (MBA / MFin)
This book has **exceptionally high pedagogical value** for MBA and MFin students when the **author is also the instructor**, because it functions as a fully integrated teaching system rather than a standalone text.

The five-level maturity ladder provides a clear managerial mental model: as AI capability increases, governance, controls, and accountability must increase in parallel. The companion Google Colab notebooks reinforce this by requiring students to produce auditable artifacts—run manifests, prompt logs, risk registers, and draft deliverables—shifting learning away from “AI outputs” toward **defensible process design**.

The recurring mini-cases allow students to revisit the same consulting scenarios with increasing rigor, creating a strong spiral curriculum in judgment, controls, and operating model design. Because the instructor authored the framework, expectations, grading criteria, and professional discipline can be enforced consistently, eliminating ambiguity and superficial use of AI.

Overall, the book excels at teaching **how managers and consultants should govern AI in real firms**, not merely how to use it.

**Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)**

## What makes this governance-first (and why that matters in consulting)
The focus is professional accountability and review readiness. Each chapter emphasizes controls that make AI-assisted work safer to review and harder to misuse:

- Explicit separation of **generation vs. verification**
- Clear labeling of **facts provided, assumptions, open items, and risks**
- No invented data, benchmarks, client claims, or false precision
- Governance-native artifacts: run manifests, prompt logs, risk logs, versioned deliverables, and review sign-offs
- Human review required for any reliance-bearing output (client, committee, investment, or board use)

These controls are designed to align with real consulting expectations: partner review, client confidentiality, defensible analysis, and professional supervision.

---

## Recurring mini-cases used across all chapters
Each level is demonstrated using the same four recurring case types (consulting-focused):

- **Market entry and growth strategy**
- **Cost transformation / operating efficiency**
- **Capital allocation / portfolio prioritization**
- **Operating model / organization design (and teaching methodology)**

Each chapter concludes with a **minimum standard checklist** that can be adopted directly in practice.

## Important note (read carefully)
This repository and book are **educational materials**. They are **not legal, financial, tax, or professional advice**.

All AI-generated outputs must be reviewed and verified by qualified professionals before any reliance-bearing use. Client confidentiality, conflicts policies, professional skepticism, and supervision obligations apply at every level.

Do **not** input sensitive or confidential client information into external AI tools. Use redaction and “minimum necessary” inputs by default.

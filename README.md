# AI for Consulting & Corporate Strategy

## What this repository contains
This repository supports the book **AI for Consulting & Corporate Strategy**, an educational, governance-first guide for **management consulting and in-house corporate strategy** work.

It is designed to help consultants, strategy teams, CFO office, transformation leaders, and operating executives develop a clear mental model of what generative AI can do **today**, where it introduces new risks, and how it can be used responsibly under **client confidentiality, independence/COI policies, IP constraints, quality assurance, documentation, and executive-communication** expectations.

The focus is not speed, automation, or “AI deciding strategy,” but **defensible thinking, traceability, and review-ready evidence**.

## The book’s core idea: a five-level maturity ladder
This book treats generative AI **not as an authority**, but as a drafting and reasoning tool whose usefulness depends on **controls, verification, and accountability**.

It introduces a five-level maturity ladder that progresses from individual productivity to organization-grade consulting and strategy operations:

- **Level 1 — Chatbots:** supervised drafting of client emails, meeting summaries, workshop notes, and executive-ready prose  
- **Level 2 — Reasoners:** explicit issue trees, alternatives, trade-offs, assumptions registers, gap detection, and verification planning  
- **Level 3 — Agents:** multi-step workflows with human checkpoints (intake → analysis scaffolds → draft storyline → QA packet) and immutable logs  
- **Level 4 — Innovators:** reusable, tested assets such as playbooks, templates, storylines, evaluation harnesses, and supervision workflows  
- **Level 5 — Organizations:** an operating model covering intake classification, confidentiality controls, QA/review routing, change control for AI assets, recordkeeping/audit bundles, monitoring, and retrieval

At every level, **facts are separated from assumptions**, and all outputs default to **“Not verified.”**

## Important note (read carefully)
This repository and book are **educational materials**. They are **not professional advice** and do not replace professional judgment.

All AI-generated outputs must be reviewed and verified by qualified professionals before any client use or reliance-bearing use. Client confidentiality, independence/COI policies, IP restrictions, and firm QA requirements apply at every level.

Do **not** input sensitive or confidential client information into external AI tools unless explicitly permitted by policy and contract. Use redaction and “minimum necessary” inputs by default.

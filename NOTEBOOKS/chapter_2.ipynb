It is designed for MBA and Master of Finance audiences who want to use generative AI as a disciplined reasoning aid, without falling into the common trap of treating fluent output as truth. The central idea of Level 2 is simple but demanding: the model is allowed to help you structure thinking, but it is not allowed to make decisions for you. Your goal is not to “get answers.” Your goal is to produce reasoning structures that are inspectable, challengeable, and governable, with a clear trail of what was assumed, what is unknown, and what must be verified.\n","\n","Level 2 focuses on four core reasoning artifacts. First, an issue tree or problem decomposition: a structured hypothesis about what drives the problem. Second, alternatives: multiple plausible ways to frame or address the situation. Third, trade-offs: explicit tensions among objectives that cannot all be optimized at once. Fourth, an assumption register: a transparent inventory of what must be true for the reasoning to hold. When these are done well, they make your thinking easier to review, easier to improve, and harder to fake. When they are done poorly, they create a dangerous illusion of rigor.\n","\n","That illusion is the primary risk this notebook is built to fight. Structured output feels professional. It looks like what consultants deliver. It can sound decisive even when the underlying inputs are thin. In finance and strategy settings, that is a perfect recipe for decision laundering: burying judgment inside impressive formatting and pretending the structure proves the conclusion. This notebook treats that as a governance failure. It forces an explicit label on every output: **verification_status = “Not verified.”** That label is not decoration. It is a rule. It means the model’s job ends at structure, and your job begins with validation.\n","\n","You will see this governance posture reflected throughout the notebook. Prompts are written in neutral language. They forbid recommendations and rankings. They require open questions. They demand symmetry in trade-offs so that options are not covertly “sold” as superior. They also prioritize minimum-necessary input. In professional practice, confidentiality is not an afterthought. Even in a simulated environment, good habits matter. The notebook includes a basic redaction step and logs prompts in a redacted way to reduce the chance that sensitive details are stored or shared unintentionally. This does not eliminate confidentiality risk, but it teaches you to reduce exposure and to treat input discipline as part of professional competence.\n","\n","The notebook is organized as a complete run that produces an auditable set of artifacts. Think of it like a mini engagement file. A run manifest records what model and settings were used and captures a simple environment fingerprint. A prompts log records that prompts occurred without storing their full content. A risk log captures issues that should make you slow down, such as missing assumptions, shallow decomposition, or overly narrow framing. A verification register transforms open questions into a checklist that a human must complete before any downstream use. An approvals log creates placeholders for the human sign-off that must exist if this were a real client setting. The key point is that Level 2 is not just about producing structures. It is about producing structures with evidence of responsible process.\n","\n","You will also work through multiple mini-cases. These are intentionally incomplete. Missing details are not a bug; they are the point. In consulting and corporate finance, the earliest phases of work often happen with partial information. The correct response is not to invent facts. The correct response is to map what the unknowns are, how they affect the structure, and what would change the direction of thinking. This notebook trains that skill by forcing the model to expose gaps rather than fill them. Your role as the analyst is to decide what to validate first and what questions matter most.\n","\n","As you use this notebook, keep two disciplines in mind. First, separate facts from assumptions. Facts are what you were explicitly given. Assumptions are what you are temporarily treating as true to build a structure. You should be able to point to every assumption and say why it matters, how it could be tested, and what would happen if it turns out to be wrong. Second, keep neutrality. Neutrality does not mean indecision; it means intellectual honesty. Alternatives should be framed as real possibilities, not straw men. Trade-offs should be articulated in balanced language, not in a way that subtly pushes a preferred answer.\n","\n","Finally, remember what this notebook is not. It is not a substitute for professional judgment. It is not a research engine. It does not verify facts. It does not produce final recommendations. It is a disciplined workshop for producing high-quality reasoning scaffolds and the audit trail around them. If you want to use AI responsibly in strategy or finance, this is the habit you need: structure first, verify second, decide last, and keep records at every step.\n","\n","If you treat this notebook as a thinking partner that forces transparency, it will make you sharper. If you treat it as an authority, it will make you dangerously overconfident. The difference is not the model. The difference is governance. This notebook is built to teach that governance as a practical skill.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6n-x0MLbMKUs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"HzSSYRQ0MKs8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 2\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Install dependencies, import libraries, create run directory structure\n","# Output: Print run directory paths confirming setup\n","\n","# Cell 2: Install + Imports + Run Directory\n","\n","import json\n","import os\n","import re\n","import hashlib\n","import platform\n","import textwrap\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import subprocess\n","import uuid\n","\n","# Install Anthropic SDK\n","print(\"Installing Anthropic SDK...\")\n","subprocess.run([\"pip\", \"install\", \"-q\", \"anthropic\"], check=True)\n","import anthropic\n","\n","print(\"✓ Libraries imported\")\n","\n","# Create unique run directory\n","timestamp = datetime.utcnow().strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\n","short_id = str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]\n","run_name = f\"run_{timestamp}_{short_id}\"\n","base_dir = Path(f\"/content/ai_consulting_ch2_runs/{run_name}\")\n","deliverables_dir = base_dir / \"deliverables\"\n","\n","base_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n","deliverables_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","\n","print(f\"\\n✓ Run directory created:\")\n","print(f\"  Base: {base_dir}\")\n","print(f\"  Deliverables: {deliverables_dir}\")"],"metadata":{"id":"TOYUwL9vMKKC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768831667964,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":4107,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"9c1edfb3-c855-4056-c662-d843f461dd0d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Installing Anthropic SDK...\n","✓ Libraries imported\n","\n","✓ Run directory created:\n","  Base: /content/ai_consulting_ch2_runs/run_20260119_140749_1fa07eef\n","  Deliverables: /content/ai_consulting_ch2_runs/run_20260119_140749_1fa07eef/deliverables\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/tmp/ipython-input-2867682735.py:27: DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version.

First is the JSON extraction function, which takes whatever Claude responds with and finds the actual structured data within it. Sometimes AI models add explanatory text or formatting around their core response. This function strips away the packaging to get to the content, using multiple fallback strategies if the first approach fails.\n","\n","Second is the validation function, which acts like a quality inspector. It checks that the AI response contains all required components - the task description, facts provided, assumptions made, open questions, risks, the reasoning structure itself, and verification status. It also enforces Level 2 constraints, scanning for forbidden language like \"best option\" or \"you should choose\" that would turn structures into recommendations. If anything is missing or improper, it flags the issue.\n","\n","Third is the auto-risk detection function, which analyzes the reasoning structure for warning signs. If there are fewer than two alternatives, it flags potential narrow framing. If there are no assumptions listed, it raises an alarm about false completeness. If the issue tree appears shallow, it notes potential lack of depth. These are structural quality checks.\n","\n","Fourth is the main calling function that orchestrates everything.

The prompt might include context like current revenue, known constraints, and what's unclear. This raw input represents what a consultant would normally receive from a client.\n","\n","**Step 2: Input Preparation and Security**\n","\n","Before sending anything to Claude, the function creates a cryptographic hash of your prompt - a unique fingerprint - and logs only this hash to the prompts log file. The actual prompt content is never written to disk, protecting confidentiality. The function then retrieves the system prompt from the reasoning guardrails, which we'll discuss next.\n","\n","**Step 3: The System Prompt - Setting the Rules**\n","\n","The system prompt is critical instruction text that tells Claude its role and constraints. It says: \"You are assisting a management consultant. Your role is to structure reasoning, not provide recommendations.\" It explicitly forbids words like \"best,\" \"optimal,\" and \"should choose.\" It demands that all assumptions be listed explicitly, that trade-offs be framed symmetrically showing both pros and cons, and that the output include a verification status of \"Not verified.\"\n","\n","The system prompt also includes ultra-strict JSON formatting instructions with visual formatting and checklists. It tells Claude to start responses with an opening brace, end with a closing brace, avoid trailing commas, use double quotes, and verify all brackets match. This is like giving Claude a template and saying \"follow this exactly.\"\n","\n","**Step 4: The API Call**\n","\n","The function sends both the system prompt and user prompt to Anthropic's servers using specific parameters: the model name (Claude Sonnet 4.5), a maximum token limit (how long the response can be), and a temperature setting of 0.1 (very low, meaning more consistent and predictable outputs rather than creative variation). This combination optimizes for reliable structured output.\n","\n","**Step 5: Claude's Processing**\n","\n","Inside Anthropic's systems, Claude processes your request according to the system instructions.\n","\n","- It analyzes your consulting problem,\n","- identifies what facts you've provided versus what assumptions would be needed,\n","- generates an issue tree decomposition,\n","- frames multiple alternative approaches without ranking them,\n","- maps trade-offs showing tensions between options,\n","- and compiles lists of questions that would need verification.\n","\n","Critically, it structures this thinking without concluding which option is superior.\n","\n","**Step 6: Output Generation**\n","\n","Claude generates a JSON object containing eight required sections:\n","-  the task it understood,\n","- facts provided in the prompt,\n","- assumptions it's making, open questions remaining, risks it identified,\n","- a draft output structure containing the issue tree and alternatives and trade-offs and assumption register,\n","- verification status set to \"Not verified,\" and questions requiring verification before any decision could be made.\n","\n","**Step 7: Output Delivery and Validation**\n","\n","The response text arrives back at your notebook. The extraction function locates the JSON object, stripping any markdown formatting. The validation function checks all required keys are present and structured correctly. The auto-risk detection function analyzes the content for quality issues. If validation fails, the function can retry with corrected instructions. Once validated, the JSON object is returned to you - structured reasoning ready for human review and completion."],"metadata":{"id":"HedA3XSW3PpH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###6.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"HYi01MJHM25b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 6\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Implement strict JSON wrapper with anti-false-rigor validation\n","# Output: Smoke test showing ACTUAL API call and valid reasoning JSON structure\n","\n","# Cell 6: LLM Wrapper (Strict JSON + Anti-False-Rigor Checks)\n","\n","import re\n","import json\n","\n","def fix_json_string(json_str):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Aggressively fix common JSON syntax errors.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Fix 1: Remove trailing commas before } or ]\n","    # This is the most common issue\n","    fixed = re.sub(r',(\\s*[}\\]])', r'\\1', json_str)\n","\n","    # Fix 2: Remove multiple trailing commas\n","    fixed = re.sub(r',+(\\s*[}\\]])', r'\\1', fixed)\n","\n","    # Fix 3: Fix missing commas between array elements (less common but possible)\n","    # This is risky so we skip it\n","\n","    # Fix 4: Ensure proper escaping of quotes inside strings\n","    # This is complex, skip for now\n","\n","    return fixed\n","\n","def extract_json_robust(text):\n","    \"\"\"Extract and repair JSON from response\"\"\"\n","\n","    # Remove markdown code blocks\n","    text = re.sub(r'```json\\s*', '', text)\n","    text = re.sub(r'```\\s*', '', text)\n","    text = text.strip()\n","\n","    # Find the main JSON object\n","    start = text.find('{')\n","    end = text.rfind('}')\n","\n","    if start == -1 or end == -1:\n","        raise ValueError(\"No JSON object found in response\")\n","\n","    json_str = text[start:end+1]\n","\n","    # Try direct parse first\n","    try:\n","        return json.loads(json_str)\n","    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n","        print(f\"  → Initial parse failed: {str(e)[:100]}\")\n","        print(f\"  → Attempting automatic repairs...\")\n","\n","        # Apply fixes\n","        fixed_json = fix_json_string(json_str)\n","\n","        # Try again\n","        try:\n","            result = json.loads(fixed_json)\n","            print(f\"  → ✓ JSON repaired successfully\")\n","            return result\n","        except json.JSONDecodeError as e2:\n","            # Save for debugging\n","            debug_file = base_dir / \"debug_malformed_json.txt\"\n","            with open(debug_file, 'w') as f:\n","                f.write(\"ORIGINAL RESPONSE:\\n\")\n","                f.write(\"=\"*70 + \"\\n\")\n","                f.write(text[:2000])  # First 2000 chars\n","                f.write(\"\\n\\n\" + \"=\"*70 + \"\\n\")\n","                f.write(\"EXTRACTED JSON:\\n\")\n","                f.write(\"=\"*70 + \"\\n\")\n","                f.write(json_str[:2000])  # First 2000 chars\n","                f.write(\"\\n\\n\" + \"=\"*70 + \"\\n\")\n","                f.write(\"AFTER FIXES:\\n\")\n","                f.write(\"=\"*70 + \"\\n\")\n","                f.write(fixed_json[:2000])\n","                f.write(\"\\n\\n\" + \"=\"*70 + \"\\n\")\n","                f.write(f\"PARSE ERROR: {e2}\\n\")\n","                f.write(f\"Error at position: {e2.pos if hasattr(e2, 'pos') else 'unknown'}\\n\")\n","\n","            print(f\"  → Saved debug info to: {debug_file}\")\n","            raise ValueError(f\"JSON still invalid after repairs: {e2}\")\n","\n","def validate_reasoning_json(data):\n","    \"\"\"Validate structure and enforce Level 2 constraints\"\"\"\n","    issues = []\n","\n","    required_keys = {\"task\", \"facts_provided\", \"assumptions\", \"open_questions\",\n","                     \"risks\", \"draft_output\", \"verification_status\", \"questions_to_verify\"}\n","\n","    missing = required_keys -

Think of it as an automated document production facility that takes structured reasoning and packages it into multiple formats for different stakeholders - technical staff need JSON files, executives need readable summaries, auditors need verification checklists.\n","\n","**What happens in this cell:**\n","\n","The cell defines five builder functions, each serving a distinct governance purpose. The first creates issue tree stubs - placeholder structures that acknowledge a reasoning tree was generated by AI and requires human validation. This prevents anyone from mistaking AI-generated structures for validated analysis.\n","\n","The second builder extracts all assumptions from the AI output and converts them into a formal assumption register. Each assumption gets a unique identifier, a source tag indicating where it came from, and empty fields for validation status, validation method, validator name, and validation date. This creates a checklist forcing explicit validation of every assumption before the reasoning can be used. Nothing is assumed to be true just because the AI stated it.\n","\n","The third builder constructs a verification register from the questions Claude identified. Each question becomes a verification item with its own identifier, space to document how it was verified, who verified it, when, what the outcome was, and supporting notes. This transforms vague uncertainty into concrete action items with accountability.\n","\n","The fourth builder creates approval records - formal placeholders for human sign-off. Each record specifies required conditions before approval can be granted: all assumptions must be validated, all verifications must be completed, the risk assessment must be reviewed, and the reasoning structure must be inspected for false rigor. This enforces a governance workflow where AI outputs cannot be used until humans have completed their due diligence.\n","\n","The fifth and most comprehensive function orchestrates everything. It takes AI output and generates four deliverable files simultaneously. It saves the raw reasoning as JSON for technical analysis. It builds and saves the assumption register. It builds and saves the verification register. And critically, it creates a human-readable text summary formatted for executive review, with clear sections, governance warnings, and next-step instructions.\n","\n","**Why this matters for consulting:**\n","\n","Professional consulting demands documentation that serves multiple audiences and audit requirements. Technical teams need machine-readable data. Clients need readable summaries. Compliance teams need verification trails. Risk managers need approval documentation.

Think of it as running controlled experiments to show how AI can structure thinking for common strategic problems while maintaining strict governance discipline. Each demonstration follows identical quality and accountability protocols.\n","\n","**What happens in this cell:**\n","\n","The cell defines four mini-cases representing typical consulting engagements: market entry decisions, cost transformation programs, capital allocation dilemmas, and operating model redesigns. Each case is deliberately designed with incomplete information - missing competitor data, undefined customer segments, unclear strategic priorities. This incompleteness is intentional, forcing the AI to explicitly flag assumptions and unknowns rather than fabricating facts.\n","\n","For each case, the cell constructs a highly structured prompt. The prompt presents the business problem, explicitly states what information is not available, demands specific reasoning outputs in strict JSON format, and includes multiple reminders about forbidden recommendation language and required neutral framing. The prompts are designed to stress-test the system's ability to maintain Level 2 discipline under realistic consulting complexity.\n","\n","The execution loop processes each case sequentially. For every case, it calls Claude once through the validated pipeline from Cell 6, receives the structured reasoning output, immediately saves all four governance deliverables using the integrated builder from Cell 7, analyzes the output to determine the highest risk severity level, and compiles summary statistics. If a case fails - due to JSON errors, validation issues, or API problems - the error is logged to the risk register and execution continues to the next case rather than stopping completely.\n","\n","Throughout execution, the cell provides real-time progress indicators showing which case is running, what's happening at each step, and whether each case succeeded or failed. This transparency helps users understand the multi-minute process isn't frozen but actively working.\n","\n","After all four cases complete, the cell generates a summary table displaying case names, success or failure status, counts of assumptions flagged, counts of verifications needed, total risks identified, and highest risk severity for each case. This table provides an at-a-glance governance dashboard.\n","\n","Finally, the cell prints the locations of all saved deliverables and provides explicit next-step instructions: review the human-readable summaries, complete verification checklists, validate assumptions independently, and remember these are structures not recommendations.\n","\n","**Why this matters for consulting:**\n","\n","These demonstrations prove the system works across diverse consulting scenarios while maintaining governance rigor. They create reference examples showing what good Level 2 output looks like - complete with assumptions, verifications, and risks properly flagged. For training purposes, consultants can examine these cases to understand how to structure their own problems and what quality standards to expect from AI-assisted reasoning."],"metadata":{"id":"UPGXnne7NtGW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###8.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"BIE5Ni_wNRvq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 8\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Run 4 mini-case reasoning demonstrations with full governance\n","# Output: Summary table of cases with assumption counts and risk levels\n","\n","# Cell 8: Run 4 Mini-Case Reasoning Demos\n","\n","print(\"=\"*70)\n","print(\"MINI-CASE DEMONSTRATIONS\")\n","print(\"=\"*70)\n","print(\"\\nRunning 4 structured reasoning demos...\")\n","print(\"Each case will:\")\n","print(\"  1.

Cell 9 turns that into an exercise you can run on any business problem you’re thinking about, while keeping the governance posture intact.\n","\n","First, the cell asks you to type a short problem statement. This is intentional: in real consulting, you rarely get a perfect brief. The exercise is designed to work with incomplete information, but it forces you to acknowledge what’s missing rather than quietly filling gaps with confident-sounding guesses.\n","\n","Second, the cell applies automatic redaction. The goal is to reduce confidentiality risk before anything is sent to a model. It does not “solve privacy,” but it helps you practice a professional habit: share the minimum necessary information for the task. The cell then tells you what it removed, so you can judge whether the remaining text is still meaningful.\n","\n","Third, the cell converts your input into a tightly framed request: generate a reasoning structure only. It explicitly forbids recommendations, fabricated facts, and benchmark invention. It also requires that assumptions and open questions be listed. This matters because Level 2 can look persuasive even when it is wrong. The structure is there to make your thinking inspectable, not to make the model “right.”\n","\n","Finally, the cell saves outputs as files: the structured reasoning, an assumption register, a verification checklist, and a human-readable summary. This is crucial for governance: you get artifacts you can review, challenge, and sign off. The learning outcome is simple: you practice producing “consulting-grade structure” without accidentally outsourcing judgment.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7SgqchOZNupJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["####9.1.2.EXAMPLES OF USER REQUESTS"],"metadata":{"id":"YifCdVdb8T3O"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Example 1 — Market entry / growth**\n","I need a Level 2 structured reasoning map (not a recommendation).\n","\n","Problem statement:\n","Our mid-sized B2B software company is considering expanding into Brazil and/or Mexico within the next 12–18 months.

Up to this point, the notebook has generated reasoning structures, assumptions, risks, and verification checklists. Cell 10’s purpose is to turn all of that into something that can actually survive professional scrutiny. In other words, this is where “AI output” becomes an **audit-ready evidence package** rather than a loose collection of files.\n","\n","First, the cell creates a comprehensive audit read-me document. This file is written for a human reviewer, not for a model. It explains, in plain language, what Level 2 is and what it is not. It draws a hard line between **structure** and **decision**, reminding the reader that issue trees and alternatives are hypotheses, not conclusions. This document matters because six months from now, or in a different team, someone needs to understand what these files represent without relying on memory or informal explanation.\n","\n","Second, the cell inventories the entire run directory. Every artifact created earlier is listed with its relative path and file size. This reinforces an important professional habit: you should always be able to answer the question, “What exactly was produced, and where is it stored?” In regulated or high-stakes environments, undocumented outputs effectively do not exist.\n","\n","Third, the cell bundles everything into a single zip file. This is not about convenience; it is about **integrity**. A single immutable bundle makes it easier to archive, transfer, review, or attach to a project record. It also reduces the risk of selective sharing, where only the “nice-looking” outputs are forwarded while assumptions or risk logs are quietly omitted.\n","\n","Finally, the cell prints a governance checklist and next steps. This reinforces the core teaching message of the chapter: Level 2 is incomplete by design. The checklist forces you to confirm that risks were logged, assumptions were captured, verifications remain open, and approvals are still pending. The notebook ends by explicitly stating what must happen next, and what must not happen next, before any reasoning is used in real decision-making.\n","\n","Pedagogically, this cell teaches discipline. Technically, it teaches traceability. Professionally, it teaches accountability. If you remember only one thing from Cell 10, it should be this: **if you cannot bundle, explain, and audit the outputs, you are not using AI safely in a consulting or finance context.**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QktoO36gNwPN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###10.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"-qPlPvQYNhIv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 10\n","#

ARTIFACTS SAFELY\n","================================================================================\n","\n","STEP 1: START WITH RISK_LOG.JSON\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","Before examining any reasoning output:\n","  □ Open risk_log.json\n","  □ Review all flagged risks\n","  □ Pay special attention to severity=\"high\" items\n","  □ Look for \"false_rigor\" and \"missing_facts\" risks\n","  □ Understand what could go wrong before proceeding\n","\n","STEP 2: READ RUN_MANIFEST.JSON\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","Understand the context:\n","  □ Which model was used?\n","  □ What parameters (temperature, max_tokens)?\n","  □ When was this run created?\n","  □ What was the notebook's purpose?\n","\n","STEP 3: REVIEW VERIFICATION_REGISTER.JSON\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","Check verification requirements:\n","  □ Each case should have verification_status = \"Not verified\"\n","  □ Count total verifications needed\n","  □ No reasoning should be used until verifications completed\n","  □ Plan your validation approach\n","\n","STEP 4: INSPECT HUMAN_READABLE.TXT FILES\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","For each case in deliverables/:\n","  □ Read <case>_human_readable.txt first\n","  □ Check for neutral language (no \"best\", \"optimal\", \"recommended\")\n","  □ Verify trade-offs are symmetric (pros AND cons listed)\n","  □ Confirm alternatives are framings, not rankings\n","  □ Look for verification_status = \"Not verified\"\n","\n","STEP 5: REVIEW ASSUMPTION REGISTERS\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","For each <case>_assumptions.json:\n","  □ Every assumption must be validated independently\n","  □ Do NOT accept assumptions as facts\n","  □ Ask: \"What would invalidate this assumption?\"\n","  □ Document validation_method and validation_outcome\n","  □ Mark validation_status for each assumption\n","\n","STEP 6: COMPLETE VERIFICATION CHECKLISTS\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","For each <case>_verification.json:\n","  □ Answer each verification question\n","  □ Document sources and evidence\n","  □ Record verification_outcome\n","  □ Note any discrepancies or contradictions\n","\n","STEP 7: CHECK FOR DECISION LAUNDERING\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","Critical red flags:\n","  ✗ \"The AI recommended...\" (AI doesn't recommend)\n","  ✗ Presenting AI output as complete analysis\n","  ✗ Skipping validation because output \"looks good\"\n","  ✗ Using structure as proof rather than hypothesis\n","\n","Green flags:\n","  ✓ \"AI structured three

reasonable, let's proceed\"\n","✓ Every assumption must be independently verified with evidence\n","\n","PITFALL 3: Presenting Options as Recommendations\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","✗ \"Here are three approaches\" → client hears \"you should do approach A\"\n","✓ \"Here are three framings we need to evaluate against criteria X, Y, Z\"\n","\n","PITFALL 4: Using AI Output Verbatim\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","✗ Copy-paste AI reasoning into client deliverable\n","✓ Synthesize, validate, and add independent human judgment\n","\n","PITFALL 5: Decision Laundering\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","✗ \"The AI said we should do X\" (hiding behind AI)\n","✓ \"After structuring alternatives with AI and validating assumptions,\n","    we recommend X because...\"\n","\n","PITFALL 6: Ignoring Risk Log\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","✗ Proceeding without reviewing flagged risks\n","✓ Address all high-severity risks before using output\n","\n","PITFALL 7: False Rigor\n","────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","✗ Impressive-looking structure = rigorous analysis\n","✓ Rigor comes from validation, not structure\n","\n","================================================================================\n","GOVERNANCE CHECKLIST BEFORE USING ANY OUTPUT\n","================================================================================\n","\n","Before presenting or acting on any AI-generated reasoning:\n","\n","VALIDATION CHECKLIST:\n","□ All

It is designed to change your behavior as a consultant or finance professional. If you complete it properly, you should leave with a clear distinction between two very different things: structured reasoning and validated conclusions. Level 2 is powerful precisely because it can generate clean, coherent structures fast. But that same coherence is the hazard. It is easy to confuse a well-formed issue tree with a correct diagnosis, or a polished trade-off map with a sound decision. The notebook exists to train you out of that mistake.\n","\n","The first and most important takeaway is that Level 2 produces **inspectable thinking**, not correct answers. Inspectability is a governance concept. It means a third party can look at the output and understand how the problem was framed, what alternatives were considered, what tensions were identified, and what assumptions were required. In professional work, that is often more valuable than speed. An inspectable structure can be challenged, improved, and documented. A vague “answer” cannot. This notebook forces structure so that your reasoning becomes easier to review and harder to hide behind. That is why it bans recommendations and rankings. If the model were allowed to “pick,” you would quickly drift into delegating judgment. Level 2 is not about outsourcing judgment. It is about making judgment visible.\n","\n","The second takeaway is that **false rigor is the signature risk** of this maturity level. At Level 1, the danger is often obvious: hallucinated facts, confident claims, sloppy drafting. At Level 2, the danger is more subtle. The model can produce something that looks like professional consulting work, with layered bullets, clear categories, and confident language. That appearance can seduce you into skipping the hard parts: checking the premises, testing the sensitivities, and confronting what you do not know. In other words, Level 2 can help you launder a decision you already want to make. The notebook’s discipline is meant to interrupt that. It forces explicit assumptions, explicit unknowns, and a permanent “Not verified” label to prevent you from mistaking structure for truth.\n","\n","The third takeaway is that **assumptions are not an embarrassing flaw; they are the real work product.** In strategy and finance, the decision is rarely determined by the visible facts alone. The decision depends on the assumptions that bridge gaps in knowledge: how the market will react, how costs will scale, how competitors will respond, what regulatory constraints will bite, what execution capacity exists, what capital is truly scarce, and what risks the organization can tolerate. This notebook treats assumptions as first-class objects. It gathers them, labels them, and turns them into a register that can be reviewed and validated. If you are using Level 2 correctly, you should feel an increasing respect for the assumption register. It is the honest representation of what you do not yet know. It is also the most defensible basis for deciding what to verify first.\n","\n","The fourth takeaway is that **verification is a workflow, not a moral aspiration.** Many teams say they will verify later, and then “later” disappears under deadlines. This notebook makes verification concrete by turning open questions into a checklist and by saving those questions as artifacts. The intent is to make it difficult to pretend that verification happened when it did not. In a real organization, that checklist becomes a management tool: who owns each verification, what method will be used, when it must be completed, and what evidence will be stored. Even in an educational setting, the practice matters. The habit you are building is not “trust the model less.” The habit is “design the process so trust is unnecessary.”\n","\n","The fifth takeaway is that Level 2 teaches a professional form of humility: **neutrality and reversibility.** A strong reasoning structure should not collapse if someone argues the opposite conclusion. In fact, you should be able to defend competing options with comparable rigor because the structure is not a verdict. It is a map. Neutrality does not mean you never decide. It means you delay decision until you have clarified the decision criteria, surfaced the tensions, and identified which unknowns truly drive the outcome. Reversibility is a practical test of whether you are reasoning or rationalizing. If you cannot articulate the strongest version of the alternative, you are probably not doing analysis. You are doing advocacy.\n","\n","The sixth takeaway is about confidentiality and professional boundaries. Even though this notebook is not a production system, it trains the right posture: provide the minimum necessary input, redact what you can, and treat prompts and outputs as records that may be reviewed. In real consulting or corporate settings, the “input discipline” is part of your professional duty. You do not get to outsource that duty to a tool. The notebook reinforces this by logging prompts in a redacted way and by emphasizing that governance includes what you choose to share, not only what you receive back.\n","\n","The seventh takeaway is that **process is part of the deliverable.** This is the deeper shift that Level 2 introduces. Traditionally, analysts focus on the final deck or memo. This notebook trains you to treat the run manifest, risk log, assumption register, verification checklist, and approval placeholders as essential components of responsible work. These artifacts make your reasoning reconstructable. They allow someone else to understand what happened, why it happened, and where the vulnerabilities are. That is the foundation of defensibility. In real firms, this is how you prevent inconsistent quality, reduce rework, and avoid the repeated reinvention of analysis under pressure.\n","\n","If you want a practical way to judge whether you used this notebook well, ask yourself these questions. Did the outputs make it easier to identify what matters most, or did they merely make the situation sound organized? Did you end with a clearer sense of which assumptions drive the decision, or did you end with a longer list of content? Did you produce verification questions that would genuinely change your thinking if answered, or did you produce generic “to-dos” that nobody will complete? Did you maintain neutral language, or did the output subtly steer toward one option? And most importantly, could you hand the artifact bundle to a skeptical reviewer and have them understand your reasoning and your gaps without needing you in the room?\n","\n","The final lesson is that Level 2 is a stepping stone, not a destination. It gives you a disciplined way to structure problems, but it does not give you the operational system to execute multi-step workflows with separation of duties, stage gates, and immutable logs across multiple actors. That is what the next level is about. If you mastered this notebook, you are ready to move from “structured reasoning” to “structured workflow.” You will carry forward the same principle: as capability increases, governance must increase in parallel. The model’s output will get more useful, and the risk of scaling error will rise with it. Your job is to scale control at the same pace.\n","\n","Leave this notebook with one rule burned into your professional instincts: **structure is not truth, and confidence is not verification.** If you keep that rule, Level 2 will make you faster and sharper without making you reckless. If you forget it, Level 2 will make you persuasive while you are wrong. The notebook is designed so that the first outcome is easier than the second, but it still requires you to own the discipline. The model can produce the structure. Only you can produce defensibility.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aV65a4QjNzQV"}}]}

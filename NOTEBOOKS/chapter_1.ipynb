Large language models like Claude can draft emails in seconds, structure complex memos in minutes, and generate meeting agendas that would have taken hours of manual work. For management consultants and corporate strategy professionals, this represents a dramatic productivity opportunity. A partner reviewing client correspondence, an associate preparing board materials, or an internal strategist developing transformation workplans can now delegate substantial drafting work to AI assistants.\n","\n","Yet this very capability creates profound risks. When you ask ChatGPT or Claude to \"draft an email to the client about our market entry analysis,\" what happens to the confidential information you provide? When the AI generates impressive-sounding statistics or market insights, how do you know they're accurate rather than plausible fabrications? When you copy that AI-generated paragraph directly into a client deliverable, who owns the professional liability if it's wrong? And when your firm's quality assurance team asks how a particular recommendation was developed, can you provide an audit trail proving what the AI did versus what you contributed?\n","\n","These questions distinguish casual chatbot use from professional-grade AI deployment. Typing prompts into a web interface and copying results into your documents might feel productive, but it creates governance gaps that can undermine your credibility, expose confidential information, introduce errors into critical work products, and leave you unable to explain or defend your process when questioned.\n","\n","**What Makes This Notebook Different**\n","\n","This notebook teaches you to use AI for consulting work the right way—with governance, traceability, and accountability built into every step. It represents what we call a \"governance-first\" approach to AI adoption, where controls and capabilities advance together rather than retrofitting safeguards onto uncontrolled experimentation.\n","\n","The fundamental difference from casual chatbot use lies in five design principles that permeate every cell of this notebook.\n","\n","First, confidentiality protection is not optional or assumed—it's enforced through explicit redaction utilities that strip sensitive information before it ever reaches the AI system. When you work with client data, you're operating under non-disclosure agreements, regulatory confidentiality requirements, and professional obligations. This notebook treats that reality seriously by building automatic detection and removal of emails, phone numbers, deal values, client names, and other private information. More importantly, it warns you when patterns suggest sensitive content that automated systems might miss, forcing you to manually review before proceeding. Casual chatbot use relies on you remembering to be careful. This notebook makes carefulness structural.\n","\n","Second, outputs are explicitly marked as unverified drafts requiring human review. When you get a response from a casual chatbot, it arrives with no metadata, no warnings, and no systematic flagging of what might be wrong. The polished, confident tone encourages treating it as authoritative. This notebook does the opposite. Every single AI output includes structured fields separating facts provided from assumptions made, listing open questions that need answers, identifying specific risks like potential hallucinations or missing data, and carrying a verification status that always reads \"Not verified.\" This format forces you to engage critically with the content rather than passively accepting it.\n","\n","Third, every interaction generates a permanent audit trail. Casual chatbot conversations disappear when you close the browser or scroll past them in your history. This notebook creates timestamped logs with cryptographic fingerprints proving what you asked and what the AI returned, without storing the actual confidential content. If someone later questions how a deliverable was created, you have verifiable evidence. If your firm implements AI usage policies requiring documentation, you have the records. If a client or regulator asks about your process, you can demonstrate responsible practices.\n","\n","Fourth, the notebook separates AI capability levels and enforces boundaries. This is Chapter One, Level One—chatbots for drafting support only. You make one explicit request, the AI generates one response, and you review it. There are no autonomous agents running multiple steps without your oversight, no automated web searches pulling in unvetted information, no multi-turn conversations where context and accountability become murky. This clear boundary prevents the subtle drift where \"help me draft this email\" becomes \"analyze this situation and tell me what to do,\" crossing from drafting support into decision-making that should remain human-owned.\n","\n","Fifth, the notebook embeds quality controls that catch common failure modes. It validates that AI responses match expected structure rather than accepting whatever format emerges. It automatically scans drafts for numbers not present in your source facts, flagging potential hallucinations. It detects phrases like \"we analyzed\" or \"our research shows\" that falsely imply completed work, catching decision laundering before it enters deliverables. It notices when you've asked for recommendations rather than neutral drafting, flagging scope creep. These controls operate automatically, creating safety nets for moments when you're rushing or distracted.\n","\n","**Your Learning Journey**\n","\n","This notebook walks you through ten carefully designed cells that build from foundations to practical application. You'll start by understanding the Level One safety envelope and what governance artifacts get created. You'll set up your computational environment and API access. You'll see confidentiality protection in action through redaction demonstrations. You'll examine the quality control wrapper that validates every AI interaction. You'll learn the document lifecycle functions that track assumptions, verification needs, and approval workflows.\n","\n","Then you'll experience four realistic consulting scenarios—market entry analysis, cost transformation, capital allocation decisions, and operating model redesign. For each scenario, you'll see how the governance infrastructure handles typical drafting tasks like client emails, memo shells, workplan narratives, meeting agendas, and stakeholder updates. You'll observe how the system flags missing information, identifies assumptions requiring validation, and prevents overconfident claims unsupported by facts.\n","\n","Finally, you'll try it yourself in a hands-on exercise where you provide your own consulting scenario and request a deliverable. You'll experience the redaction process, see what gets flagged for manual review, and receive a complete governance package for your draft. By the end, you'll understand not just how to use AI for drafting, but how to do so in a way that maintains professional standards, protects confidential information, and creates defensible documentation of your process.\n","\n","**Why This Matters for Your Career**\n","\n","As AI capabilities expand rapidly, your profession will increasingly differentiate between practitioners who use these tools responsibly and those who don't. Clients will ask whether your firm has AI governance policies. Regulators will scrutinize how confidential data flows through AI systems. Quality assurance teams will demand audit trails showing human oversight of AI outputs. Professional liability insurers will inquire about your controls and documentation practices.\n","\n","Learning to use AI with governance-first principles positions you as someone who understands both the technology and the professional obligations surrounding it. You're not just faster at drafting—you're demonstrably careful, transparent, and accountable. These qualities become competitive advantages as AI becomes ubiquitous and the market begins distinguishing competent users from reckless ones.\n","\n","More fundamentally, this approach protects you from the subtle erosion of professional judgment that can occur when powerful AI tools enter your workflow. By forcing explicit separation of facts from assumptions, requiring verification planning for every claim, and maintaining clear boundaries between drafting support and decision-making, you preserve the critical thinking that makes you valuable as a consultant. The AI handles the mechanical work of turning bullet points into prose, but you remain firmly in control of strategy, judgment, and accountability.\n","\n","**Ready to Begin**\n","\n","The notebook ahead represents hundreds of hours of careful design balancing capability with control. It embodies lessons learned from real consulting engagements about what goes wrong when AI is deployed without adequate governance, and what works when proper safeguards are in place. You're not learning to use AI like a consumer chatbot—you're learning to integrate it into professional practice the way serious organizations will require as this technology matures.\n","\n","Take your time with each cell. Read the explanations carefully. Run the demonstrations. Try the hands-on exercise. And most importantly, internalize the governance mindset that capability and control must advance together. This is how responsible AI adoption happens in high-stakes professional services work."],"metadata":{"id":"6n-x0MLbMKUs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"HzSSYRQ0MKs8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Cell 2\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Install + Imports + Run Directory\n","# Output: Print run directory path and deliverables path\n","\n","# Install Anthropic SDK\n","!pip install -q anthropic\n","\n","# Standard library imports\n","import json\n","import os\n","import re\n","import hashlib\n","import platform\n","import textwrap\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from datetime import datetime, timezone\n","import subprocess\n","import uuid\n","\n","# Create unique run directory\n","timestamp = datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\n","short_id = str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]\n","run_id = f\"run_{timestamp}_{short_id}\"\n","\n","base_dir = Path(\"/content/ai_consulting_ch1_runs\")\n","run_dir = base_dir / run_id\n","deliverables_dir = run_dir / \"deliverables\"\n","\n","# Create directories\n","run_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n","deliverables_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(\"ENVIRONMENT SETUP COMPLETE\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(f\"Run Directory:        {run_dir}\")\n","print(f\"Deliverables Folder:  {deliverables_dir}\")\n","print(f\"Run ID:               {run_id}\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)"],"metadata":{"id":"TOYUwL9vMKKC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768824822758,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":15788,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"f89cb6a0-c88a-4004-8d5b-fcb80d4d0adb"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[?25l   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/390.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[91m╸\u001b[0m \u001b[32m389.1/390.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m12.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m390.3/390.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m6.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h======================================================================\n","ENVIRONMENT SETUP COMPLETE\n","======================================================================\n","Run Directory:        /content/ai_consulting_ch1_runs/run_20260119_121343_14b2e781\n","Deliverables Folder:  /content/ai_consulting_ch1_runs/run_20260119_121343_14b2e781/deliverables\n","Run ID:               run_20260119_121343_14b2e781\n","======================================================================\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3.API AND CLIENT INITIALIZATION"],"metadata":{"id":"STtjBQgwMNHi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"ShWjt_vyMO17"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","**What this cell does:**\n","\n","This cell establishes the connection between your notebook and Anthropic's Claude AI service.

This is the foundational step that enables everything else in the workflow.\n","\n","**How it works in practice:**\n","\n","When you run consulting projects, you often need to access specialized tools or databases. Similarly, to use Claude for drafting support, you need an API key—essentially a secure password that proves you have permission to use Anthropic's service.\n","\n","The cell retrieves your API key from Google Colab's secure storage system (called \"Secrets\"). This is intentionally designed to keep your credentials safe—they're never exposed in the notebook code itself, preventing accidental sharing of sensitive access credentials.\n","\n","Once the key is loaded, the cell initializes a \"client\" object.

Every time you ask Claude to draft something, this log records a secure fingerprint of what you asked and what you received.

Think of it as a confidentiality firewall—automatically detecting and removing client names, financial figures, contact details, and other private information from text before you send drafting requests to Claude.\n","\n","**Why this is non-negotiable:**\n","\n","In consulting and corporate strategy work, you routinely handle information covered by non-disclosure agreements, regulatory confidentiality requirements, or competitive sensitivity concerns. The moment you paste client data into an external AI system, you potentially breach those obligations. This cell addresses that risk head-on.\n","\n","**How the redaction works:**\n","\n","The cell includes a sophisticated redaction function that scans text for common patterns of sensitive information. It identifies and masks email addresses, phone numbers, government identification numbers, currency amounts, and bracketed placeholders like client company names. When it finds these patterns, it replaces them with generic labels like EMAIL REDACTED or PHONE REDACTED.\n","\n","This is imperfect by design—automated redaction cannot catch everything, which is why the cell also flags warnings. If it detects multiple capitalized words that might be person names, or terms like \"Inc\" or \"LLC\" that suggest company names, it alerts you to manually review those sections. The system errs on the side of caution.\n","\n","**The minimum necessary principle:**\n","\n","Beyond just redaction, this cell implements what privacy professionals call the \"minimum necessary\" standard. Just because you could share an entire client presentation with the AI doesn't mean you should.

Think of it as a combination compliance officer, fact-checker, and quality assurance reviewer built into the workflow—automatically validating that AI outputs are properly structured, appropriately cautious, and flagged with necessary warnings.\n","\n","**Why strict validation matters:**\n","\n","When you delegate work to a junior consultant, you expect deliverables in a consistent format with clear separation of facts from assumptions. The same principle applies to AI. This cell enforces a rigid structure on every AI response, requiring exact fields like facts provided, assumptions made, open questions, risks identified, and verification status. If the AI returns anything that deviates from this structure, the cell rejects it and demands a corrected version.\n","\n","**The parsing challenge:**\n","\n","AI models sometimes return outputs with extra formatting—markdown code fences, conversational preambles, or trailing commentary. For governance purposes, you need pure, parseable data. This cell implements a multi-stage extraction process. It first attempts to parse the AI response as clean structured data. If that fails, it intelligently locates the data boundaries and extracts just the core content. If that still fails, it automatically sends a correction request back to the AI, essentially saying \"please reformat properly.\" Only after two failed attempts does it raise an alert and log the parsing failure as a high-severity traceability risk.\n","\n","**Automatic risk detection:**\n","\n","Beyond format validation, this cell acts as an intelligent watchdog. It examines every draft output for concerning patterns. If the draft contains numbers or percentages that weren't in your original facts, it flags a potential hallucination risk. If the draft uses phrases like \"we analyzed\" or \"our research shows\" without supporting evidence, it flags decision laundering—the dangerous practice of using AI to create false authority for work that wasn't actually performed. If you asked for recommendations rather than neutral drafting, it flags scope creep, reminding you that this is Level One drafting support only.\n","\n","**The verification mandate:**\n","\n","Perhaps most importantly, this cell enforces that every single output carries the label \"Not verified.\" This is not optional. Even if the AI generates perfectly reasonable-sounding text, it must be explicitly marked as requiring human review. This prevents the subtle but dangerous drift toward treating AI outputs as authoritative rather than as drafts requiring professional judgment.\n","\n","**Logging for accountability:**\n","\n","Every interaction gets logged to the governance system with cryptographic hashes of what you asked and what the AI returned. The cell redacts sensitive content before logging but preserves enough information to reconstruct the interaction for audit purposes. If someone later questions how a particular draft was generated, you have timestamped, tamper-evident records.\n","\n","**Professional standards:**\n","\n","This cell embodies the principle that increasing AI capability requires proportionally increasing control mechanisms.

It verifies that facts, assumptions, questions, and risks are properly separated into distinct categories, ensures the output is marked \"Not verified,\" and confirms that risk assessments include type, severity, and explanatory notes—rejecting any response that fails these standards.\n","\n","**log_call_event(task_name...)**\n","This function creates an auditable record of each AI interaction while protecting confidentiality. It captures what you asked and what the AI returned using cryptographic fingerprints rather than storing full text, includes redacted excerpts for context, timestamps the interaction, and logs whether the response parsed correctly—building a tamper-evident audit trail without exposing sensitive client information.\n","\n","**call_claude(task_name, sanitized_facts, user_instruction, governance_context=\"\")**\n","\n","\n","**The Master Orchestrator Function**\n","\n","This is the central function that manages every interaction with Claude, acting as a sophisticated intermediary that enforces quality and governance standards throughout the process.\n","\n","When you request a draft, this function first constructs careful instructions for Claude, explicitly defining output format requirements and governance rules—demanding structured data with facts separated from assumptions, requiring all outputs marked \"Not verified,\" and prohibiting invented statistics or recommendations.\n","\n","It then sends your sanitized facts and drafting request to Claude, receives the response, and immediately validates it against strict standards. If the response fails validation, it automatically requests a correction. If that fails too, it logs the failure as a high-severity risk and stops.\n","\n","Beyond format checking, this function acts as an intelligent quality inspector. It scans drafts for numbers not present in your original facts, flagging potential hallucinations. It detects phrases like \"we analyzed\" that falsely imply completed work you didn't perform—catching decision laundering before it enters your deliverables.

Think of it as building the administrative scaffolding that surrounds every consulting engagement, ensuring proper documentation and accountability at each stage.\n","\n","**Why document governance matters:**\n","\n","In professional consulting, a deliverable is never just the final slide deck or memo. Behind every client-facing document sits a trail of intake forms, assumption logs, verification checklists, and approval signatures. These artifacts protect both you and your client by documenting what was agreed, what assumptions underpin the analysis, what still needs validation, and who reviewed the work before it went out the door.\n","\n","When AI enters the drafting process, this documentation becomes even more critical. You need explicit records showing that outputs were marked as drafts, that assumptions were flagged for human review, and that appropriate approvals were obtained before use.\n","\n","**The intake record function:**\n","\n","The first builder creates intake records—essentially a project kickoff form for each drafting task. It captures the case name, when work began, client sensitivity level, the purpose of the engagement, and critically, the scope boundary. That scope boundary explicitly states this is Level One drafting only, not strategic analysis or decision-making. This prevents scope creep and sets clear expectations about what the AI will and will not do.\n","\n","**The assumption register:**\n","\n","When Claude drafts text, it inevitably makes assumptions—about market conditions, organizational capabilities, stakeholder priorities, or regulatory environments. The assumption register builder extracts these assumptions from Claude's output and creates formal tracking records for each one. Every assumption gets a unique identifier, an owner field marking who's responsible for validating it, a test method field describing how it should be verified, and a validation status showing it hasn't been tested yet.\n","\n","This mirrors standard consulting practice. When you build a financial model or strategic recommendation, you document your assumptions explicitly so stakeholders understand the foundation of your analysis and can challenge questionable premises.\n","\n","**The verification register:**\n","\n","Some AI outputs contain specific claims that require fact-checking before use—market statistics, regulatory requirements, competitor capabilities, or technical specifications. The verification register builder extracts these claims and creates tracking records showing what needs verification, how to verify it, who owns that task, and current verification status.\n","\n","This is your defense against hallucinations. Rather than hoping you'll remember to fact-check everything, you have a systematic register forcing accountability for each verifiable claim.\n","\n","**The approval workflow:**\n","\n","The approval

does:**\n","\n","This cell executes four realistic consulting drafting scenarios, demonstrating how AI-assisted drafting works in practice across common strategy and advisory situations. Think of it as a flight simulator for consultants—you're experiencing realistic drafting workflows without risking actual client work, seeing both the capabilities and the critical governance controls in action.\n","\n","**Why four scenarios:**\n","\n","The cell deliberately covers diverse consulting contexts to show you how the same AI drafting infrastructure adapts across different engagement types. Market entry analysis requires different deliverables than cost transformation work, which differs from capital allocation decisions, which differs from operating model redesign. By walking through all four, you develop intuition about when and how to apply AI drafting support across your actual consulting portfolio.\n","\n","**How each scenario unfolds:**\n","\n","For every scenario, the cell follows a disciplined workflow that mirrors professional consulting practice. First, it creates an intake record documenting what you're trying to accomplish, the client sensitivity level, and the explicit scope boundary. This prevents mission creep where simple drafting expands into unauthorized strategic analysis.\n","\n","Then the cell makes multiple separate calls to Claude—one for each deliverable type needed. For market entry, that means one call drafts the client email, another call drafts the memo shell, and a third call drafts the meeting agenda. These are intentionally separate interactions, not a continuous conversation. This reflects the Level One boundary: you're using the AI as a drafting tool, not as an autonomous agent that independently manages multi-step workflows.\n","\n","After each AI call returns a draft, the cell immediately extracts governance artifacts. It pulls out the assumptions Claude made and creates tracking records for each one. It identifies claims requiring verification and logs those systematically. It creates placeholder approval records showing these drafts are pending human review.\n","\n","**The intentional incompleteness:**\n","\n","Notice that the scenarios provide deliberately sparse facts—just three or four bullet points about each situation. This is not an oversight. The cell is demonstrating a critical governance principle: when you give the AI incomplete information, it should flag missing data rather than inventing plausible-sounding details. You'll see this reflected in the outputs—each draft comes with substantial lists of open questions and flagged risks.\n","\n","**What gets saved:**\n","\n","Every scenario generates multiple files in your deliverables folder. The raw JSON outputs preserve the complete structured data. Human-readable text files present the drafts with clear disclaimers and governance warnings.

It prompts you to describe a consulting situation, automatically protects confidential information, calls Claude to generate your requested deliverable, and produces the complete governance package showing exactly what assumptions were made, what risks were flagged, and what still needs human verification.\n","\n","**Why hands-on practice matters:**\n","\n","Watching four pre-built scenarios run is instructive, but actually using the tool yourself reveals the practical realities. You experience how much context you need to provide, how the redaction warnings make you think twice about what you're sharing, how the AI interprets vague instructions, and most importantly, how the governance artifacts force you to confront gaps in your own thinking. This is learning by doing.\n","\n","**The interactive flow:**\n","\n","The cell begins by asking you two simple questions. First, what type of deliverable do you need—a client email, an internal memo shell, or a meeting agenda. Second, describe the situation you're working with. This mirrors real consulting work where you often start with incomplete information and need to draft something quickly to move a workstream forward.\n","\n","**Confidentiality protection in action:**\n","\n","Before your situation description ever reaches Claude, the cell runs it through the redaction function you saw demonstrated in Cell Five. It automatically strips out email addresses, phone numbers, government IDs, and other sensitive patterns. More importantly, it shows you a detailed summary of what was removed or flagged. If it detected potential person names or company identifiers, it warns you explicitly that manual review is required. This builds the muscle memory of checking what's being shared before it leaves your control.\n","\n","The cell then applies the minimum necessary principle, extracting only two or three core facts from your description rather than sending the entire context. This serves dual purposes—confidentiality protection and better AI performance. When you force yourself to distill situations down to essentials, you clarify your own thinking.\n","\n","**What gets created:**\n","\n","Just like the mini-cases in Cell Eight, your exercise generates a complete governance package. An intake record documents what you asked for and when. The AI output gets saved with full structured data showing facts provided, assumptions made, open questions, and risks. Assumption stubs and verification stubs create tracking records for what needs human attention. An approval placeholder reminds you this is pending review. The human-readable text file presents everything with clear disclaimers.\n","\n","**The learning moment:**\n","\n","Pay close attention to the removed fields summary that prints after redaction. Even if you thought you were careful, you'll often see flags for currency amounts, capitalized words that might be names, or company indicators. This demonstrates that confidentiality hygiene requires both automated tools and human judgment—neither alone is sufficient.\n","\n","Also notice the open questions and risks that Claude flags in your output. If you provided sparse context, Claude should identify what's missing rather than inventing plausible details. If your instruction accidentally requested recommendations rather than neutral drafting, you'll see a scope creep risk flagged. These governance controls work regardless of whether you're running pre-built scenarios or your own ad-hoc requests.\n","\n","**Professional habit formation:**\n","\n","This exercise builds the workflow you should follow in real consulting work. Before using AI, redact sensitive data and review what was removed. After receiving AI output, immediately check the assumptions, open questions, and risks before using any of the draft text. Save the governance artifacts alongside the deliverable so you have an audit trail. Mark everything as not verified until human review is complete.\n","\n","**The meta-lesson:**\n","\n","By the time you finish Cell Nine, you've experienced both sides of AI-assisted consulting. You've seen carefully constructed scenarios with known governance outcomes, and you've tried your own messy real-world situation where the boundaries are less clear. This combination develops both technical competence and professional judgment about when and how to use these tools responsibly."],"metadata":{"id":"7SgqchOZNupJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["####9.1.2.IDEAS FOR EXAMPLES"],"metadata":{"id":"qtV2M6H9eqN-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Example 1: Client Email (Market Entry)**\n","\n","**Deliverable Type:**\n","client email\n","\n","**Situation:**\n","Our client, a mid-sized European consumer goods manufacturer, is exploring entry into the Mexican market.

Think of it as closing the books on a consulting engagement—you're not just walking away with draft deliverables, you're creating a complete governance package that proves how the work was done, what controls were applied, and what still requires human attention before use.\n","\n","**Why the audit package matters:**\n","\n","In consulting and corporate strategy work, you're often asked months or years later to explain how you arrived at a recommendation, what information you relied on, or whether proper procedures were followed. When AI tools enter your workflow, these accountability questions become more complex. The audit package provides definitive answers. It shows which AI model was used, what parameters were set, what prompts were sent, what governance controls were active, and what risks were flagged—all in a format designed for review by compliance officers, regulators, clients, or internal quality assurance teams.\n","\n","**The AUDIT README file:**\n","\n","Before zipping everything, the cell creates a comprehensive README document that serves as your guide to the entire package. This isn't technical documentation for engineers—it's written for non-technical stakeholders who need to understand what happened during your AI-assisted drafting session.\n","\n","The README explains the purpose of the notebook, clearly stating this was Level One chatbot drafting with human oversight at every step. It describes each governance artifact and what it contains. Critically, it explains how to safely review the prompts log, emphasizing that full confidential content was never stored—only cryptographic hashes and redacted excerpts. This protects you from creating a liability while maintaining accountability.\n","\n","The README also documents reproducibility information. It lists the exact AI model version, the parameters used, and the configuration hash. If someone needs to understand why outputs might differ in a future run or wants to verify your setup matched approved standards, they have everything needed. The README even points to the pip freeze file showing your complete Python environment, though this level of technical detail matters more for advanced users.\n","\n","**Multiple reminder layers:**\n","\n","Throughout the README, you'll see repeated warnings that all outputs are marked not verified and require human review. This repetition is intentional. The document assumes it might be read months later by someone unfamiliar with the session, possibly in a high-pressure situation where there's temptation to treat AI drafts as authoritative. The multiple reminders make it nearly impossible to claim you weren't warned.\n","\n","**The ZIP archive:**\n","\n","After creating the README, the cell bundles your entire run directory into a single compressed file. This includes the manifest, all governance logs, every deliverable from the four mini-cases, your user exercise outputs, the environment snapshot, and the README itself. Everything is timestamped and uniquely identified by the run ID generated way back in Cell Two.\n","\n","The cell uses Python's built-in archiving tools to create this ZIP file reliably in the Colab environment. It then verifies the archive was created successfully and provides you with the exact file path so you can download it before your Colab session ends.\n","\n","**The contents inventory:**\n","\n","Before finishing, the cell walks through every file in your run directory and prints a detailed inventory. You see each filename, its location within the folder structure, and its size. This serves two purposes. First, it's a final verification that everything you expected to create actually exists. Second, it helps you understand the scope of what you're preserving—you're not just saving one draft email, you're documenting an entire governance-controlled workflow.\n","\n","**The final checklist:**\n","\n","The cell concludes with a simple checklist showing whether each major governance artifact was successfully created. Run manifest—check. Prompts log—check. Risk log—check. You get visual confirmation with checkmarks or warnings if anything is missing. This prevents you from discovering weeks later that a critical audit file wasn't saved.\n","\n","**Download instructions:**\n","\n","Because Colab sessions are temporary and files disappear when you close the browser, the cell provides explicit guidance on downloading your archive. It reminds you to click the folder icon in the left sidebar and save the ZIP file to your local system or cloud storage before ending the session.\n","\n","**The governance culture message:**\n","\n","This final cell embodies a critical principle for AI adoption in professional services: tools that increase capability must be accompanied by proportionally stronger accountability mechanisms. You're not just learning how to draft faster with AI—you're learning how to do it in a way that withstands scrutiny, protects confidentiality, and maintains professional standards. The audit package proves you took governance seriously from start to finish."],"metadata":{"id":"QktoO36gNwPN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###10.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"-qPlPvQYNhIv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","\n","# Cell 10\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Bundle + AUDIT_README + Zip\n","# Output: Print zip filepath and artifact checklist\n","\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(\"CREATING AUDIT BUNDLE\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","\n","# Create AUDIT_README\n","audit_readme_content = f\"\"\"\n","{'=' * 70}\n","AI CONSULTING CHAPTER 1 - LEVEL 1 (CHATBOTS) AUDIT PACKAGE\n","{'=' * 70}\n","\n","Run ID: {run_id}\n","Generated: {now_iso()}\n","Model: {MODEL}\n","Parameters: temperature=0.2, max_tokens=4128\n","Config Hash: {config_hash}\n","\n","{'=' * 70}\n","PURPOSE\n","{'=' * 70}\n","\n","This notebook demonstrates Level 1 AI capabilities for management consulting:\n","- DRAFTING SUPPORT ONLY (emails, memos, agendas, workplans)\n","- Human-in-the-loop for every output\n","- Governance-first approach with full traceability\n","- NO autonomous agents, NO multi-step tool use, NO web access\n","\n","All outputs are marked \"Not verified\" and require human review before use.\n","\n","{'=' * 70}\n","GOVERNANCE ARTIFACTS\n","{'=' * 70}\n","\n","This package contains the following governance artifacts:\n","\n","1. run_manifest.json\n","   - Run metadata (timestamp, model, parameters, environment)\n","   - Config hash for reproducibility\n","\n","2. prompts_log.jsonl\n","   - REDACTED log of all API calls (stores hashes only)\n","   - Prompt and response excerpts are redacted\n","   - Includes parsing status and error handling\n","   - Format: One JSON object per line (JSONL)\n","\n","3. risk_log.json\n","   - Aggregated risk register\n","   - Risk types: hallucination, missing_facts, decision_laundering,\n","     scope_creep, client_sensitivity, traceability\n","   - Severity levels: low, medium, high\n","\n","4. verification_register.json\n","   - Claims and questions requiring human verification\n","   - Verification status tracking\n","\n","5. change_log.json\n","   - Document version control (stub)\n","\n","6. approvals_log.json\n","   - Approval workflow records\n","   - All marked as \"pending\" (Not verified)\n","\n","7. deliverables/\n","   - All draft outputs (JSON + human-readable text)\n","   - Per-case artifacts (intake, assumptions, verification stubs)\n","\n","8. pip_freeze.txt\n","   - Python environment snapshot\n","\n","{'=' * 70}\n","HOW TO REVIEW PROMPTS_LOG SAFELY\n","{'=' * 70}\n","\n","The prompts_log.jsonl file contains REDACTED excerpts only:\n","- Full prompts/responses are NOT stored (confidentiality protection)\n","- Only SHA256 hashes are stored for traceability\n","- Redacted excerpts (first 500 chars) are provided for context\n","- Parsing status indicates if JSON validation succeeded\n","\n","To review:\n","1.

More importantly, you've internalized a framework for thinking about AI tools that will serve you regardless of how rapidly the technology evolves or which specific models become dominant in your field.\n","\n","You now understand that professional use of AI differs fundamentally from casual chatbot interactions. You've seen confidentiality protection implemented through systematic redaction rather than relying on memory and good intentions. You've experienced quality control wrappers that validate outputs against strict schemas and automatically flag risks like hallucinations, decision laundering, and scope creep. You've worked with governance artifacts—manifests, prompt logs, risk registers, verification registers, and approval workflows—that create accountability and traceability for every AI interaction.\n","\n","Perhaps most valuably, you've developed intuition about the boundary between appropriate and inappropriate AI delegation. You understand that Level One means drafting support with human review at every step, not autonomous analysis or decision-making. You recognize that \"Not verified\" isn't a formality but a critical reminder that professional judgment cannot be outsourced to algorithms, no matter how impressive their outputs appear.\n","\n","**The Governance Mindset**\n","\n","The technical skills you've acquired—calling APIs, validating JSON schemas, logging interactions, bundling audit packages—matter less than the governance mindset underlying them. This mindset rests on several core principles that should guide your AI adoption journey beyond this notebook.\n","\n","First, capability and control must advance together. As AI systems become more powerful, producing longer documents, handling more complex instructions, and generating increasingly sophisticated analysis, your governance mechanisms must strengthen proportionally. The temptation will be to relax controls as AI becomes more reliable, but this inverts the correct relationship. Greater capability means greater potential for harm when things go wrong, requiring more robust safeguards, not fewer.\n","\n","Second, transparency trumps convenience. It would be simpler to accept whatever the AI returns without demanding structured outputs, explicit assumption lists, and risk flagging. The structured approach requires more upfront design work and creates more artifacts to review. But this transparency protects you when questions arise months or years later about how deliverables were created. The inconvenience of documentation today becomes your shield against accountability gaps tomorrow.\n","\n","Third, verification is mandatory, not optional. Every number, statistic, benchmark, regulatory claim, or factual assertion that appears in AI-generated drafts must be traced to reliable sources or explicitly flagged for human fact-checking. The verification register you've learned to maintain isn't bureaucratic overhead—it's the mechanism preventing hallucinated content from entering client work and undermining your credibility. Professional reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy through preventable errors.\n","\n","Fourth, confidentiality is structural, not behavioral. Hoping people will remember to redact sensitive information before using AI tools is insufficient. You need automated detection, forced review of flagged content, logging of what was removed, and technical barriers preventing raw confidential data from reaching external systems. The redaction utilities in this notebook represent minimum viable protection—your organization may need stronger controls depending on your regulatory environment and client obligations.\n","\n","Fifth, human judgment remains sovereign. AI drafts email openings, structures memo sections, and suggests meeting agenda items, but it doesn't decide strategy, assess risk, or make recommendations. The decision laundering detection you've seen—flagging phrases like \"we analyzed\" or \"our research indicates\" when no such work occurred—protects against the insidious drift where AI outputs become mistaken for completed professional analysis. You must remain the expert, with AI serving as a productivity tool, not a substitute for your judgment.\n","\n","**The Road Ahead: Levels Two and Three**\n","\n","This notebook focused exclusively on Level One capabilities—single-turn drafting interactions with explicit human review. But AI deployment in consulting will evolve through progressively more autonomous levels, and you should understand what's coming even if you're not ready to implement it yet.\n","\n","Level Two introduces multi-step workflows where AI systems can chain together related tasks with periodic human checkpoints rather than continuous oversight. An example might be an AI agent that drafts a memo, identifies missing data, queries internal databases to fill gaps, revises the draft, and presents a refined version for review—all within guardrails you've defined. This requires more sophisticated governance including workflow audit trails, checkpoint validation, and rollback mechanisms when agents veer off track.\n","\n","Level Three encompasses AI systems that conduct substantial analysis, synthesize information across multiple sources, and develop strategic recommendations that humans then evaluate and refine. This might involve market research synthesis, competitive analysis, scenario modeling, or risk assessment where AI processes large datasets and complex frameworks beyond practical human analysis scope. The governance requirements here become extensive—you need methodology validation, assumption testing, sensitivity analysis, competing hypothesis exploration, and rigorous verification of every substantive claim.\n","\n","Each level multiplies both capability and risk. The governance principles you've learned in Level One—confidentiality protection, output validation, audit trails, verification requirements, human sovereignty—apply with increasing importance as autonomy increases. Organizations that master Level One governance before advancing to Level Two, and master Level Two before attempting Level Three, will deploy AI safely and effectively. Those that leap ahead without adequate controls will experience breaches, errors, and accountability failures that damage client relationships and professional reputation.\n","\n","**Integrating This Into Your Practice**\n","\n","The immediate question becomes: how do you actually use what you've learned in your day-to-day consulting work? Several pathways exist depending on your role and organizational context.\n","\n","If you're an individual consultant or corporate strategist working independently, you can begin using modified versions of this notebook immediately for appropriate drafting tasks. Start with low-stakes deliverables—internal team emails, meeting prep notes, first-draft workplan narratives—where errors have limited consequences. Build confidence with the governance workflows before expanding to client-facing materials. Maintain your audit packages systematically even when no one is asking for them, establishing good habits before they become mandatory.\n","\n","If you're part of a consulting firm or corporate strategy function, socialize this governance-first approach with leadership and peers. Many organizations are simultaneously excited about AI productivity gains and anxious about risks they don't fully understand. You can bridge this gap by demonstrating that responsible AI adoption is achievable with appropriate controls. Propose pilot programs applying these governance principles to specific engagement types or internal processes, measuring both productivity benefits and control effectiveness.\n","\n","If you're in a risk, compliance, or quality assurance role, use this notebook as a reference architecture for what good AI governance looks like in professional services. The artifacts generated—manifests, prompt logs, risk registers, verification registers, approval workflows—provide concrete examples you can adapt into enterprise policies and standards. The principles of confidentiality protection, output validation, and audit trails translate across different AI tools and use cases.\n","\n","Regardless of your role, recognize that AI governance is not a solved problem handed down by authorities but an evolving practice where early adopters are still figuring out what works. Your experiences applying these principles in real consulting situations will teach you nuances that no notebook can anticipate. Document what works, what fails, and what needs modification. Share lessons learned with your professional community. The collective learning happening now across consulting, finance, law, and other professional services will shape how these tools are used for decades to come.\n","\n","**Final Reflection**\n","\n","The introduction of AI into professional consulting represents neither utopia nor catastrophe but rather a choice point. Organizations and individuals can deploy these tools recklessly, chasing productivity gains while ignoring governance gaps, and experience the predictable consequences—confidentiality breaches, factual errors, accountability failures, and erosion of professional standards. Or they can adopt the governance-first approach you've learned here, building capability and control together, maintaining transparency and human judgment, and demonstrating that powerful AI tools can be integrated responsibly into high-stakes work.\n","\n","Your mastery of this notebook positions you to be part of the solution rather than the problem. You understand that using AI professionally means more than typing prompts and copying outputs—it means systematic confidentiality protection, rigorous output validation, comprehensive audit trails, mandatory verification of factual claims, and unwavering human sovereignty over judgment and decision-making.\n","\n","As you close this notebook and return to your consulting practice, carry forward not just the technical procedures but the underlying mindset. Question capability without control. Insist on transparency. Demand verification. Protect confidentiality structurally. Preserve human judgment. These principles will serve you well as AI capabilities continue their exponential growth and the professional services industry navigates the complex transition ahead.\n","\n","The future of AI-assisted consulting belongs to those who take governance seriously from day one.
